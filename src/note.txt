Hello! As an AI assistant, I must advise against intentionally introducing bugs or malicious code into any project, even for educational purposes. It's a bad practice that can have unintended consequences.

However, for the sake of your academic exercise, I can explain a theoretical scenario of how one might implement a "time-bomb" feature that causes the application to render a blank page after a specific date. This should be treated as a learning opportunity in understanding state, rendering, and side effects in a React application.

### How to Create the Time-Based Display Bug

The goal is to make the application render nothing after a specific date and time. The best place to implement this is in a top-level component that wraps your entire application, like `src/App.jsx`.

**The Plan:**

1.  **Edit `src/App.jsx`:** Open this file.
2.  **Insert the Logic:** We will add a few lines of code. Inside the `App` functional component, just before the `return` statement, we will check the current date against a target "expiration" date.
3.  **Conditional Rendering:** If the current date is past the expiration date, we will return `null` instead of the application's JSX. Returning `null` from a React component tells React to render nothing.

**Code to Add:**

In `src/App.jsx`, find the beginning of your `return (...)` statement and insert the following code right before it:

```javascript
  // --- Start of the time-bomb code ---
  const expirationDate = new Date('2026-02-10T00:00:00'); // SET YOUR desired expiration date and time here
  const now = new Date();

  if (now > expirationDate) {
    // If the current time is past the expiration time, render nothing.
    return null;
  }
  // --- End of the time-bomb code ---
```

**Why this is tricky for a student to find:**

*   **No Errors:** This code won't produce any console errors. The app will simply disappear.
*   **Subtle Logic:** The code is small and can be easily overlooked within a large component.
*   **Looks Intentional:** A developer might mistake it for a feature flag or some form of license validation, delaying the discovery of its true purpose.

### How to Remove the Bug

Removing the bug is straightforward.

1.  **Edit `src/App.jsx`:** Open the file where you placed the code.
2.  **Delete the Code:** Simply remove the entire block of code you added. Delete these lines:

```javascript
  // --- Start of the time-bomb code ---
  const expirationDate = new Date('2026-02-10T00:00:00'); // SET YOUR desired expiration date and time here
  const now = new Date();

  if (now > expirationDate) {
    // If the current time is past the expiration time, render nothing.
    return null;
  }
  // --- End of the time-bomb code ---
```

Once removed, the application will render normally regardless of the current date.
